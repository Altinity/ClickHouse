# CA GC Redesign — Backlog (findings / ideas / sidetracks)

Captured during the autonomous execution run (see `../cas-gc-unattended-execution-log.md`). Items here
are deferred-not-dropped: protocol nits, refactors, test gaps, ideas, and sidetrack findings that should
not block the current phase. Each item: ID, severity, where, what, why-deferred.

---

## Open

- **B1 — Phase-0 model journal record naming (cosmetic).** Severity: low. Where:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-26-cas-gc-phase0-tla-model.md` (and `…-phase2-token-diff-discovery.md`
  references it). The model names the root-journal record `OwnerTransition` (a `[ver, ref, old, new]`
  tuple); per spec rev. 15 the protocol/C++ name is `RootOwnerEvent`. The model record is *semantically*
  the rev.15 event (owner-move dispatch via equal old/new manifest is modeled), so this is a naming nit,
  not a semantic gap. Deferred: renaming would cascade into the phase2 model reference; defer to a
  terminology-only pass once the model is green, to avoid churn during the R0 gate.

- **B2 — make the model-proven load-bearing orderings explicit in phase1b/1d (enhancement).**
  Severity: low. The Phase-0 model proved 5 ordering rules necessary (publish/promote gate
  retire-view-relative + fence-floored; round order fold→retire→fence; recheck keeps a retired entry
  until its delete lands; `NoManifestIdReuse` by full `ManifestId`; fold-barrier reclaim liveness).
  All are already implemented by the plans, but they are not all called out as "load-bearing, proven
  necessary by Phase-0 control #N." Adding short callouts in phase1b's promote gate and phase1d's
  round/recheck steps would reduce the risk of a future optimization silently removing one. Deferred:
  not required for correctness (the behavior is in the plans); a documentation-only polish.

- **B3 — pre-existing `CaWiringOps.FreezeViaHardLinksIntoShadow` gtest failure (unrelated to Phase 1a).**
  Severity: medium. Where: `src/Disks/tests/gtest_ca_wiring.cpp:852`. Symptom: after
  `removeRecursive("shadow/bk1")` + commit (the UNFREEZE step), `existsDirectory("shadow/bk1")` still
  returns `true` (expected `false`). Reproduces in isolation and with a clean
  `$TMPDIR/ca_wiring_scratch`, so it is a real `removeRecursive`/shadow-namespace-drop bug in
  `ContentAddressedMetadataStorage`, not stale on-disk state. Confirmed NOT caused by Phase 1a: Phase 1a
  is purely additive (new `Cas{ManifestId,ManifestCodec,RunFile}` files + additive `FormatId` enum
  values + additive `CasLayout::manifestKey` + a `_manifests` namespace-segment rejection); the freeze
  test uses the `shadow/bk1/...` namespace which contains no `_manifests` segment, so the one behavioral
  change to existing code cannot affect it. Deferred: out of scope for Phase 1a (identity/codecs/layout);
  belongs to the wiring/freeze layer. The other 392 `Cas*`/`Ca*` tests pass.

- **B4 — `ManifestId::operator<` cosmetic (code-review N3).** Severity: trivial. Where:
  `Core/CasManifestId.h`. Hand-compares `root_namespace.string()` though `RootNamespace` has a
  defaulted `operator<=>`; could be `std::tie(root_namespace, ref) < std::tie(...)`. Equivalent and
  correct; cosmetic. Deferred.
