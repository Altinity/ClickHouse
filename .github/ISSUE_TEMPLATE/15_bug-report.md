âœ…  *I checked [the Altinity Stable Builds lifecycle table](https://docs.altinity.com/altinitystablebuilds/#altinity-stable-builds-life-cycle-table), and the Altinity Stable Build version I'm using is still supported.*

## Type of problem
Choose one of the following items, then delete the others: 

**Bug report** - something's broken

**Incomplete implementation** - something's not quite right

**Backwards compatibility issue** - something used to work, but now it doesn't

**Unexpected behavior** - something surprising happened, but it wasn't the good kind of surprise

**Installation issue** - something doesn't install they way it should

## Describe the situation

## How to reproduce the behavior

* Which Altinity Stable Build version to use

* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to an unexpected result
