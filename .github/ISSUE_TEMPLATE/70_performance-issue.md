## Describe the situation
What exactly works slower than expected?

## How to reproduce the behavior

* Which Altinity Stable Build version to use
* Which interface to use, if matters
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to slow performance

## Expected performance
What performance did you expect? Did the system work faster in older Altinity Stable Builds?  

## Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here, including logs, error messages, stacktraces, and screenshots.
