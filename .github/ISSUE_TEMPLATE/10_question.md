> Make sure to check the [Altinity documentation](https://docs.altinity.com/) and the [Altinity Knowledge Base](https://kb.altinity.com/) first. If the question is concise and probably has a short answer, asking it in the [the Altinity Slack channel](https://altinitydbworkspace.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1togw9b4g-N0ZOXQyEyPCBh_7IEHUjdw#/shared-invite/email) is probably the fastest way to find the answer. For more complicated questions, consider [asking them on StackOverflow with "clickhouse" tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/clickhouse).
